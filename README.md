# USM2
Version 2 of [Universal Sequence Maps](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4017330/) (USM), to support work on folding alignment and make the most of ES6 to support client and server side computing with the same codebase. Live at [usm.github.io/2](https://usm.github.io/2)!

The USM2 library was put to the test to support live [suplementary material](https://usm.github.io/2), also at [Observable Notebook](), for manuscript [Iterating scale-independent Genomic signatures, from COVID to Cancer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eJKrbnUdMq2cZDv19rBQfhsRIaodMlAlmMNWUq05YSQ/edit#).
